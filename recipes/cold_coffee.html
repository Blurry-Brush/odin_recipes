        <h2> Description</h2>

        <p> Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee in the normal way and then serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can also be sweetened with pre-dissolved sugar in water.

            Pre-packaged iced coffee is available as a grocery item in several countries, though without ice. Iced coffee is also regularly available in most coffee shops. Iced coffee is generally brewed at a higher strength than normal coffee, since it is diluted by the melting ice.</p>

                <li> Put ice cubes in a blender jar and add coffee, milk, honey, cream and about two tablespoons of ice cream. If you donâ€™t have a blender just take a shaker and put milk, honey, coffee, cream and give it a nice stir and then shake it! If you like your cold coffee extra creamy, then add some fresh cream and shake it well.</li>
