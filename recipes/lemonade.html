    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Lemonade is a sweetened lemon-flavored beverage.

        There are varieties of lemonade found throughout the world.[1] In North America and South Asia, cloudy lemonade dominates. It is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup or honey.[2] In the United Kingdom and Australia, clear lemonade and yellow lemonade, a carbonated drink, is more common.[3][self-published source?] Despite the differences between the drinks, each is known simply as "lemonade" in countries where it is dominant.[3]</p>
